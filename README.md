# TeamManager-Repo
I created an application that allows a user to input information about their favorite basketball players and their playing status.
This app uses a React JS front-end and Express in the back-end. It also uses MongoDB and Node.

The player status page shows whether each of the players is registered to play, not play or is undecided.
